# Gilded Rose starting position in Python

For exercise instructions see [top level README](../../Downloads/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-main/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-main/README.md)

Suggestion: create a python virtual environment for this project. See the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## Run the unit tests from the Command-Line

```
python test_gilded_rose.py
```

## Run the TextTest fixture from the Command-Line

For e.g. 10 days:

```
python texttest_fixture.py 10
```

You should make sure the command shown above works when you execute it in a terminal before trying to use TextTest (see below).


## Run the TextTest approval test that comes with this project

There are instructions in the [TextTest Readme](../../Downloads/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-main/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-main/texttests/README.md) for setting up TextTest. You will need to specify the Python executable and interpreter in [config.gr](../../Downloads/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-main/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-main/texttests/config.gr). Uncomment these lines:

    executable:${TEXTTEST_HOME}/python/texttest_fixture.py
    interpreter:python
